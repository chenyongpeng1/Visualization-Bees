# Visualization-Bees
This is a visualization of US agricultural dependence on honey bees and their declining health status. As part of a 2 person team, I used the R Shiny libraries to make an interactive web application to eplore some of the data.

The data were all obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA collects data on stressors to bee colonies, changes in numbers of bee colonies, honey production, and pollination costs in order to help track risk factors and mortality for our nationâ€™s main pollinators. Specifically, 3 csv files spanning 2015-2016 were analyzed. The files consisted of numerical, categorical, as well as temporal data. Analysis focuses attention on the current decline of honey bees as well as their importance in the production of the crops we consume daily.
